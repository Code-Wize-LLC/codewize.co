                <h2 class="mt-4 text-3xl md:text-4xl font-bold text-stone-900 tracking-tight mb-5 leading-snug">We built it because we saw the problem firsthand.</h2>

                    <p>Most small businesses in Miami were being handed off to generalist IT vendors who didn't understand their industry, or handed budget software that sort of worked but required constant workarounds. We'd seen accountants trying to run year-end in a patched-together server room. Contractors using spreadsheets to track half-million-dollar jobs. Insurance agencies losing leads because their CRM didn't talk to their intake form.</p>
                    <p>Code Wize started from a simple premise: if you know one industry well, you can serve that industry far better than anyone else. So instead of trying to be everyone's IT partner, we built deep expertise in three verticals — contractors, accountants, and insurance agencies — and refused to take on work outside of it.</p>
                    <p>Over ten years later, we're still doing it the same way: fixed-price engagements, honest scope conversations, and systems that work without constant hand-holding.</p>
